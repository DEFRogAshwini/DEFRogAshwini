[^fn2]: I have exactly zero tolerance for bigotry. I don't find bigoted jokes funny.

[^fn3]: _I think the ["What Kind of Pusheen Are You?" quiz](https://pusheen.com/what-kind-of-pusheen-are-you/) is just as accurate, and unscientific as the Myers-Briggs Personality Test, but way more fun._

[^fn4]: _I write stories about ducks, peacocks, and the like._

[^fn5]: _I usually draw frogs and cats. Feel free to make custom frog requests._

[^fn6]: _I name all of them. You are welcome to ask me about them._
